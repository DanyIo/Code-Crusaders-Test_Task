### Backend Implementation

The backend of the Financial Management Program is implemented using C# programming language and MySQL as the database management system. The backend handles data storage, retrieval, and processing operations. Key components of the backend include:

- **Data Models**: The backend defines data models using C# classes to represent entities such as users, income, expenses, and deposits. These models define the structure and properties of the data stored in the MySQL database.

- **Database Connectivity**: The backend establishes a connection with the MySQL database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data. It utilizes libraries and frameworks such as Entity Framework Core to simplify database interactions.

- **API Endpoints**: The backend exposes RESTful API endpoints that enable communication between the frontend and backend components of the application. These endpoints handle HTTP requests and execute corresponding database operations to retrieve or modify data.

- **Business Logic**: The backend contains business logic that governs the behavior of the Financial Management Program. This logic includes calculations for budget management, data validation, and other operations necessary for maintaining the integrity of financial data.
